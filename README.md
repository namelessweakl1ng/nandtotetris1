This repository contains my solutions and work for **Part I of the Nand to Tetris course** (also known as *From NAND to Tetris – Building a Modern Computer from First Principles*).
In this part of the course, the focus is on building the fundamental hardware components of a computer using the **Hardware Description Language (HDL)** provided in the course tools.

## Course Overview

The Nand to Tetris course guides students through building a complete computer system from the ground up.
Part I focuses on:

* Boolean logic
* Combinational chips
* Sequential chips
* Memory units
* CPU architecture
* Basic computer construction

All designs are tested using the official course hardware simulator.

## Repository Structure

* **project1** – Boolean Logic
  Implementation of basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, MUX, DMUX, etc.) built from NAND gates.

* **project2** – Boolean Arithmetic
  Implementation of arithmetic circuits such as Half Adder, Full Adder, Add16, and ALU components.

* **project3** – Sequential Logic
  Implementation of memory elements including Bit, Register, RAM modules, and counters.

* **project4** – Machine Language
  Programs written in Hack assembly language to run on the Hack platform.

* **project5** – Computer Architecture
  Construction of the Hack CPU and integration into a complete computer system.

* **project6** – Assembler
  Development of an assembler that translates Hack assembly language into machine code.

## Tools Used

* Nand to Tetris Hardware Simulator
* Nand to Tetris Software Suite
* HDL (Hardware Description Language) provided by the course

## How to Run the Projects

1. Download the **Nand to Tetris software tools** from the official website.
2. Open the **Hardware Simulator** or **CPU Emulator** depending on the project.
3. Load the corresponding `.hdl` or `.asm` files from the project folder.
4. Run the provided test scripts (`.tst`) to verify correctness.

## Learning Outcomes

Through these projects, I learned:

* How logic gates combine to form complex circuits
* How memory and CPU components function internally
* The fundamentals of computer architecture
* How machine language interacts with hardware
